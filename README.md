## Vision-Based Collision Avoidance 

### Overview
One of several key applications of computer vision algorithms is performing navigation tasks with robots around obstacles, primarily using visual information in order to avoid collisions.

#### Purpose
Contain computer vision algorithms needed to perform Vision-based Collision Avoidance. These algorithms may be used in various combinations, pipelines or standalone depending upon the complexity and/or requirement of fulfillment of a task.

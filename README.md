## Vision-Based Collision Avoidance 

### Overview
One of several key applications of computer vision algorithms is performing navigation tasks with robots around obstacles, primarily using visual information in order to avoid collisions.

The purpose of existence of this repository is to contain computer vision algorithms needed to perform Vision-based Collision Avoidance. These algorithms may be used in various combinations, pipelines or standalone depending upon the complexity and/or requirement of fulfullment of a task.
